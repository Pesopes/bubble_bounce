# Bubble bounce

A simple 2-player game designed primarily for mobile use.

It is written in pure JS.

The concept is based on one of the mini-games in the game called **Shmatoosto** by [Yiotro](https://yiotro.com/about/). Sadly it's been unpublished since due to increasing demands from google on the play store.

## Notes

The require bounce option is not actually implemented and does nothing.
