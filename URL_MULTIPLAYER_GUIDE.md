# URL-Based Multiplayer Guide

## 🎮 **How It Works**

Your Bubble Bounce game now has **URL-based multiplayer** - no servers needed!
The entire game state is encoded in the URL, making it perfect for playing with
friends anywhere in the world.

## 🚀 **Quick Start**

### **Starting a New Game:**

1. Click **"SHARE & PLAY"** from main menu
2. Click **"Start New Game"**
3. Game creates a URL containing the initial state
4. Copy and share this URL with your friend

### **Joining a Game:**

1. Receive URL from your friend
2. Open the URL in your browser
3. Game automatically loads the current state
4. You can immediately take your turn!

## 🔗 **URL Structure**

```
https://yoursite.com/#game=ABC123...XYZ
```

The URL contains:

- **Game ID**: Unique identifier for the game
- **Turn Number**: Current turn in the game
- **Game State**: Positions of all bubbles and blocks
- **Settings**: Ball count, blocks enabled, etc.
- **Current Player**: Whose turn it is

## 📱 **Sharing Options**

The system provides several sharing methods:

### **Copy to Clipboard**

### **Turn-by-Turn Progress**

```
Turn 1: You create game → Share URL
Turn 2: Friend opens URL → Takes turn → Shares new URL

...and so on
```

4. **Bookmark important games**: Save URLs of close games

### **Troubleshooting:**

## 🌍 **Perfect for International Play**

### **Why It's Great for Japan Distance:**

- ✅ **No server lag** - everything is local
- ✅ **Works offline** - just need to share URLs
- ✅ **Time zone friendly** - play when convenient
- ✅ **No accounts** - just share links
- ✅ **Works anywhere** - any device with browser

### **Typical Game Flow:**

```
🇺🇸 You: Create game → Share URL via WhatsApp
🇯🇵 Friend: Opens URL 8 hours later → Takes turn → Shares back
🇺🇸 You: Open new URL → Continue game
```

## 🎨 **Future Enhancements**

Planned features:

- **Visual turn indicator** in URL menu
- **Game history** tracking
- **Tournament brackets** via URL chains
- **Spectator mode** (view-only URLs)
- **Custom game rules** in URL

## 🔧 **For Developers**

The system is modular and extensible:

```typescript
// Create game URL
const url = URLMultiplayer.generateShareURL(bubbles, blocks, ...);

// Load from URL
const gameState = URLMultiplayer.loadFromURL();

// Validate state
const isValid = URLMultiplayer.validateGameState(gameState);
```

All game logic remains unchanged - the URL system just serializes/deserializes
the existing game state!
